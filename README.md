# Zabbix MySQL monitoring plugin (with LLD)

Extensive monitoring plugin for MySQL, including operational status, metrics, command counters AND slave-to-master monitoring by comparing table checksums.

The slave monitoring is implemented through an extensive use of the powerful **low-level discovery** features available in Zabbix. As a result, only what gets replicated on the slave is actually monitored.

## Installation
Depending on how you distribute your plugins around and respective Zabbix configuration, you would at least need to set up the following userparameters on the agent side:

```
UserParameter=mysql[*],<path_to_your_plugins>/mysql.sh $1
UserParameter=mysql.replication[*],<path_to_your_plugins>/mysql.sh replication $1
UserParameter=mysql.replication.checksum[*],<path_to_your_plugins>/mysql.sh replication checksum $1
UserParameter=mysql.replication.discovery,<path_to_your_plugins>/mysql.sh replication discovery
```

You would then need to import the templates into Zabbix and link them to the hosts you wish to monitor.

**Before importing the template**, you are required to add the following value mappings before importing the templates, so that sampled values can be mapped to human readable states (makes latest data look prettier).

```
mysql> SELECT name, value, newvalue FROM valuemaps INNER JOIN mappings ON valuemaps.valuemapid = mappings.valuemapid WHERE name LIKE 'MySQL%';
+----------------------------------------------+-------+-------------+
| name                                         | value | newvalue    |
+----------------------------------------------+-------+-------------+
| MySQL - IO thread status                     | -1    | Disabled    |
| MySQL - IO thread status                     | 0     | Running     |
| MySQL - IO thread status                     | 1     | Not running |
| MySQL - Master read/exec log position status | 0     | In sync     |
| MySQL - Master read/exec log position status | 1     | Out of sync |
| MySQL - Slave replication table status       | 0     | Identical   |
| MySQL - Slave replication table status       | 1     | Different   |
| MySQL - Slave replication table status       | -1    | Absent      |
| MySQL - SQL thread status                    | -1    | Disabled    |
| MySQL - SQL thread status                    | 0     | Running     |
| MySQL - SQL thread status                    | 1     | Not running |
+----------------------------------------------+-------+-------------+
```

## Configuration
By default, the plugin makes use of the **$HOME/.my.cnf** config file to connect to the local MySQL instance. You should probably look at distributing this via Puppet.

If you run zabbix-agentd as root, you would have to configure /root/.my.cnf as follows:

```
[client]
user=root
host=localhost
password=<your_password>
```

When it comes to slave monitoring, you would need to make sure that the following environment variables are defined in **mysql.cfg** in the same directory where the plugins gets installed.

```
export MYSQL_MASTER_HOST="<master_host>"
export MYSQL_MASTER_USER="<master_user>"
export MYSQL_MASTER_PASSWORD="<master_password>"
# number of times the checksum will be re-calculated if differs from the master
export MYSQL_CHECKSUM_RETRY=
```
